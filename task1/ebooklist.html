               <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">  Philosophy, history, wit, and the most passionate love story.
                It is a truth universally acknowledged that when most people 
                think of Jane Austen they think of this charming and humorous story of love, difficult families and the 
                tricky task of finding a handsome husband with a good fortune.</p><br><br>

                     <p style="text-align: justify;"  id="image"> A jarring & poignantly beautiful story about how humans treat each other.
                        A novel before its time, Harper Lee’s Pulitzer-prize winner addresses issues of race, inequality and segregation with both levity and compassion. Told through the eyes of loveable rogues Scout and Jem, it also created one of literature’s most beloved heroes – Atticus Finch, a man determined to right the racial wrongs of the Deep South.</p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">The greatest, most scathing dissection of the hollowness at the heart of the American dream. Hypnotic, tragic, both of its time and completely relevant. Jay Gatsby, the enigmatic millionaire who throws decadent parties but doesn’t attend them, is one of the great characters of American literature. This is F. Scott Fitzgerald at his most sparkling and devastating. </p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">Magic realism at its best. Both funny and moving, this book made me reflect for weeks on the inexorable march of time Gabriel García Márquez’s multi-generational spanning magnum opus was a landmark in Spanish literature. </p><br><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">In this groundbreaking novel, completed after six arduous years of research, Capote invented a new genre - the 'Nonfiction Novel' - applying prose techniques to fact. It spawned the school of New Journalism & invented the true crime genre as we know it.
                    The 'true crime' TV show / podcast you're obsessed with probably owes a debt to this masterpiece of reportage by Truman Capote. Chilling and brilliant. </p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">  Rhys took a character from a classic novel and breathed new life into the “madwoman in the attic” based on her own experiences/world view. She beautifully showed how the stories we read fold into our lives to make new stories.
                    Jean Rhys wrote this feminist and anti-colonial prequel to Charlotte Bronte’s novel Jane Eyre which chronicles the events of Mr Rochester’s disastrous marriage to Antoinette Conway or Bertha as we come to know her. </p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">Given the exponential growth of AI, Machine Learning & Robotics, Huxley's vision acts as a warning. Will we rise and challenge those who seek to shape our future or sleepwalk toward conditioning by technology?
                     One of the greatest and most prescient dystopian novels ever written, this should be on everyone's
                     must-read list. </p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">A 'children's book' that speaks volumes (ha) about unrequited love and dysfunctional families. Timeless. And funny.
                     Cassandra Mortmain's upbringing in a crumbling castle with her eccentric family may not be everyone’s experience, but we can guarantee her coming-of-age story with all its enchanting and disenchanting moments will resonate for many.</p><br><br>

                <p style="text-align: justify;" id="image">One of literature's steeliest heroines, in her short life Jane Eyre has overcome a traumatic childhood only to be challenged by secrets, strange noises and mysterious fires in her new home of Thornfield Hall. All while falling in love with her employer, Mr Rochester. A Gothic masterpiece which was groundbreaking in its intimate use of the first-person narrative.
                    Because Jane is a role model: she stands up for herself, others and what she believes in, but isn't too proud to give second chances to those whose time is running out. </p><br>

His parents are dead and he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p>
